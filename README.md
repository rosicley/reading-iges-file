# reading-iges-file

In this project, Iâ€™m trying to modify the [pyiges](https://github.com/pyvista/pyiges) library according to my needs.

The objective is to read an IGES file and export the necessary data to the [3dSolid](https://github.com/rosicley/3dSolid) project in order to facilitate data input for a solid mechanics simulation using an isogeometric discretization.
For this, I also intend to use the [NURBS-Python](https://github.com/orbingol/NURBS-Python) library.
